Tiny Planet is a mixed 2D/3D educational game that teaches players about the impacts of their actions on the environment. Players complete a number of mini-games that contain best practices in day-to-day life for environmental conservation. Their performance on these mini-games impacts global score parameters such as water levels, air pollution, and forest growth. The objective of the game is to complete all mini-games without destroying the environment.
